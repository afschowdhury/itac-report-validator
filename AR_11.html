<p style="text-align:center"><b>Observation and Analysis</b> </p>
<p>During the assessment, an evaluation of the facility's inventory management system revealed a reliance on an existing ERP system that primarily tracks inventory but lacks functionality for job cost accounting, comprehensive raw material flow tracking, and tool lifespan monitoring. The implementation of an advanced inventory management system integrating job cost accounting, tool lifespan tracking, and compatibility with SolidWorks and GibbsCAM is recommended. This system would enable real-time monitoring of raw materials from receipt to finished product, proactive maintenance of tools based on usage patterns, and more precise cost allocation for each job. By introducing such a system (see Figure 4-4), the facility can optimize inventory management, improve operational efficiency, and enhance overall productivity.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<p>We recommend implementing an advanced inventory management system,,  that tailored to the facility's unique needs. This system should include features such as job cost accounting, raw material flow tracking, and tool lifespan monitoring. Integration with existing design software like SolidWorks and GibbsCAM would ensure seamless communication between inventory and production planning. Furthermore, the system should automate inventory tracking, optimize reorder points, and provide real-time data on tool usage and wear. This approach would minimize tool failures, enhance workflow efficiency, and reduce manual errors in cost and inventory management. By adopting such a solution, the facility can significantly enhance operational efficiency, reduce waste, and improve productivity.  </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Calculations</b> </p>
<p>The cost savings for this recommendation can be realized from the reduced hours attributed to repeated correction of inventory entries and reduced administrative work as more automated process is involved. Manual inventory management tasks consume a significant amount of time, with a single team member spending approximately 16 hours weekly (i.e., 3.2 hrs/day) on tasks that can be automated to increase efficiency and accuracy. For our calculations, we conservatively estimate 1.5 hr/day in administrative savings attributable to the modification of the inventory control.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Administrative Savings </i></p>
<p>The time saved from reduced manual entries and repeated work is estimated below:</p>
<p>ACS	= Ds × Dw × Wy × HR</p>
<p>= 1.5 hr/day × 5 days/week × 52 weeks/yr × $25/hr</p>
<p>= $9,000/yr</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Where</i>, </p>
<p>ACS	= Administrative Cost Savings</p>
<p>Ds	= Hourly Savings from Modified Inventory Control</p>
<p>Dw 	= Days of Operation per Week</p>
<p>Wy	= Weeks of Operation per Year</p>
<p>HR 	= Hour Rate at the facility.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Total Cost Saving of the facility calculated by;</i></p>
<p>Here, the total cost savings is equal to the administrative cost savings</p>
<p>TCS	= ACS</p>
<p>= $9,000/yr</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Where,</i>  </p>
<p>TCS	= Total Cost Savings, $</p>
<p>ACS 	= Administrative Cost Savings, </p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Implementation Cost</b> </p>
<p>The implementation cost of the advanced inventory management system will include the cost of initial setup and purchase of the software. The implementation cost will depend on the level of customization that the facility wishes to implement. For our calculations, we have the initial setup to be $8,000 and the licensing for the software to be $17,000. Hence, the total implementation cost is $25,000.</p>
<p>		IC = $25,000</p>
<p><i>Payback Period</i> </p>
<p>PP	= IC/TCS </p>
