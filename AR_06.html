<p><i>AR No. </i><i>6</i><i> – </i><i>Consider Replacement of Old Motors with Energy-Efficient Ones</i></p>
<p>Replacing old motors with energy-efficient alternatives will optimize energy consumption and improve operational performance. This energy efficiency measure will yield $2,510 in total cost savings and incur an implementation cost of $10,600. The project has a payback period of 4.22 years and will reduce CO₂ emissions by 9 tons annually, with annual energy savings of 24,612 kWh.</p>
